EarthDaily Constellation is flying in 2024 - The Most Advanced Change Detection System With the most spectrally diverse range ever designed for a commercial mission, EarthDaily’s superspectral initiative will alter our understanding of how our planet is changing. Quality Providing  seamless access to the EarthDaily satellite data stream, with daily global high-resolution coverage in 22 spectral bands, automatically calibrated and processed to the highest scientific quality for direct to algorithm deployment.

This access also provides the ability to train and evaluate machine learning models to extract information from satellite imagery. A historical data set is required to develop methodologies for assimilating satellite data into various models, including those related to weather, climate change, land-atmosphere interactions, and many others.
